# PSICHE

PSICHE (Processor of Spectral Index: Calculation Homogenized Eexperiments) is a Python package designed for the analysis and evaluation of spectral indices and reaction rates from fission fragment spectra. The package provides a comprehensive set of tools for handling, processing, and analyzing nuclear data, specifically focusing on fission fragment spectra, effective mass, and reaction rates.

## Features

- **Fission Fragment Spectrum Analysis**: Tools to handle and analyze fission fragment spectra data.
- **Effective Mass Calculation**: Methods to compute effective mass from integral data.
- **Reaction Rate Computation**: Functions to calculate reaction rates using fission fragment spectra and effective mass.
- **Spectral Index Calculation**: Tools to compute spectral indices by comparing reaction rates.
- **C/E Calculation**: Compute C/E values from simulated and experimental data.

## Installation

To install the package, clone the repository and use pip to install the dependencies:
